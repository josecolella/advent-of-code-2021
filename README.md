## Introduction

This repository contains the solution to the [Advent of Code Problems](https://adventofcode.com/)
The solutions leverage the Ruby programming language in order to exercise some of the syntax to better understand Ruby. I will be leveraging rspec, and sorbet to practice on technologies that are widely used for Ruby codebases. 

*DISCLAIMER*

There is likely a better Ruby way to solve these problems, but these solutions are for me to practice Ruby. 

## Developing

This uses the VSCode Remote Containers plugin, so that no dependencies need to be installed expected for the Docker runtime. Once inside VSCode, just select the option to `Rebuild and Reopen in Container`
